# aidTec_Iris-Flower-Classification
This repository contains 1st task of my Machine Learning Internship offered by Info Aidtech.
My first task was to apply classification algorithm on IRIS Flower dataset using Decision Tree algorithm or KNN.
I have implemented this project using KNN Algorithm as it is faster than Decisison Tree as well as efficient.
I hope you like my work...
